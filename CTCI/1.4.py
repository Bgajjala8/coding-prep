# Palindrome  Permutation:  Given  a  string,  write a function  to  check  if it  is a  permutation  of a  palin-
# drome.  A  palindrome  is a  w o r d  or  phrase  that  is  the  same  forwards  and  backwards.  A  permutation 
# is a  rearrangement of letters. The palindrome  does  not  need  to  be  limited  to just  dictionary words. 

# To be a plaindrome 
# First would be - count each ones. Only one can be odd which would be the middle number 
# then for permutation you would need to
